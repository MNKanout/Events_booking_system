# Events_booking_system
This project was designed to allow users to register in events, and automatically assign them seat numbers at their arrivals after they have been checked in by staff members. This application was developed as a solution to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus when having big gatherings.

- Project structure:

  - Authentication app: This app handles the process of authenticating users.
  - Events app: This app handles the process of creating, editing, and deleting events.


- Type of users:

  - Regular users: Create a new profile, and can register/unregister from events.
  - Staff members: Check in regular users at their arrival in addition to monitoring who came, and who didn't to the event.
  - Managers: Create, edit, and delete events in addition to the staff members' privileges.
